# Pintos-project-3

Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. Detailed explanation can be found in [offical doc](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos).

This version of pintos is built on top of a well implemented version from project 2.

Our project 3 implementation focused on lazy loading, stack growth, file memory mapping and swapping.

Have fun.
